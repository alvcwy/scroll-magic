# Scroll Magic

This demo uses the Scroll Magic library to place a video in the background, allowing you to play the video by scrolling down the webpage. 

### Why?
- Allows for slow-mo playback
- Can pause at an exact moment
- Play the video in reverse by scrolling backwards

This can be extended to recreate webpages like [Apple's AirPods animation](https://www.apple.com/airpods-3rd-generation/).
